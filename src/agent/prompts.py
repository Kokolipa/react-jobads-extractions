WRITE_TODOS_DESCRIPTION = """Create and manage structured task lists for tracking progress through complex workflows.

## When to Use
- Multi-step or non-trivial tasks requiring coordination
- When user provides multiple tasks or explicitly requests todo list  
- Avoid for single, trivial actions unless directed otherwise

## Structure
- Maintain one list containing multiple todo objects (content, status, id)
- Use clear, actionable content descriptions
- Status must be: pending, in_progress, or completed

## Best Practices  
- Only one in_progress task at a time
- Mark completed immediately when task is fully done
- Always send the full updated list when making changes
- Prune irrelevant items to keep list focused

## Progress Updates
- Call write_todos again to change task status or edit content
- Reflect real-time progress; don't batch completions  
- If blocked, keep in_progress and add new task describing blocker

## Parameters
- todos: List of TODO items with content and status fields

## Returns
Updates agent state with new todo list."""


TOOL_USAGE_PROMPT = """Based upon a user's request:
1. Use write_todos to create a TODO at the start of the user's request, per the tool description.
2. When you accomplish a TODO, use read_todos to read the TODOs in order to remind yourself of the plan.
3. Reflect on what you've done and the TODO.
4. Mark your task as completed, and proceed to the next TODO item.
5. Continue this process until you have completed all the TODO items created."""
